			<p>For hundreds of years before the 18th century, central and western Europeans had been digging up strange-looking bones along lakebeds and riverbanks. What made the spectacular skeleton of the marine reptile Mosasaurus important was that it was the first fossil to be positively identified (by the naturalist Georges Cuvier) as belonging to an extinct species. From this point on, scientists realized they were dealing with creatures that lived, and died, millions of years before humans had even appeared on Earth.</p>
