			<p> the quetzalcoatlus, genus made up of two species of giant pterosaurs classified in the family Azhdarchidae, which contains some of the largest known flying animals. Both species lived during the Maastrichtian Age (72.1 million to 66 million years ago) of the Cretaceous Period. One of them, Quetzalcoatlus northropi, is widely believed to have been the largest flying creature that ever lived. Q. northropi is known from a single set of fossils representing six individuals. Those fossils were found in the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park in Texas in the early 1970s and were first described in 1975. The other species, Q. lawsoni, is known from roughly 300 bone fragments representing a number of smaller individuals discovered at the same time and location, but the species was not described until 2021.</p>

			<p>In 2001, Kirkland et al. pursued a graduate student's discovery of a bone protruding from a 9-ton fossil block of sandstone in eastern Utahraptor. It was determined to contain the bones of at least seven individuals, including an adult measuring about 4.8 m (16 ft), four juveniles, and a hatchling about 1 m (3.3 ft) long. Also fossilized with the Utahraptor pack are the remains of at least one possible iguanodont. Kirkland speculated that the Utahraptor pack attempted to scavenge carrion or attack helpless prey mired in quicksand, and were themselves mired in the attempt to feed on the herbivore. Similar sites such as the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry and California's La Brea Tar Pits house such predator traps. Examination of the fossils are ongoing after a decade of excavation, but if Kirkland is correct, it may be one of the best-preserved predator traps ever discovered. The fossils may further reveal aspects into the behavior of Utahraptor, such as whether it might have hunted in groups like Deinonychus was believed to have done. Whether all the Utahraptor individuals were mired simultaneously or were drawn in, one-by-one is unclear.[23] Further examination of the block suggests that the number of Utahraptor remains may be double the amount previously assumed.</p>
