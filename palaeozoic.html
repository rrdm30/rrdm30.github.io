			<P>this is the hylonomus the first known lizard to walk the earth.The hylonomus is one the first reptiles in the world. It appeared during the Carboniferous period in what is today Nova Scotia. It was one the first to escape the water and lay eggs with a calcium shell. It may have ate small insects and a target to larger predators like Meganeura.And this is what we think it looked like.</P>
